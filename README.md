# React Native Todo App

Welcome to my React Native Todo App! This app was developed as part of the RocketSeat challenge for the first module. I've added my personal touch to the design and functionality, and I've learned a lot throughout the process. This ReadME will guide you through the setup, features, and usage of the app.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to manage your tasks.
- **Task Creation**: You can easily create new tasks by tapping the "+" button and entering the task details.
- **Task List**: All your tasks are displayed in a scrollable list, showing the task name and its completion status.
- **Task Completion**: Tap on a task to mark it as completed. A completed task will be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks.
- **Task Deletion**: Swipe left on a task to reveal the delete option. This allows you to remove tasks you no longer need.

## What I Learned

Developing this app was a great learning experience. Some of the key takeaways include:

- **React Native Fundamentals**: I gained a strong understanding of React Native components, state management, and navigation.
- **Styling**: I learned how to style components using both inline styles and external stylesheets.
- **User Interaction**: Implementing task completion and deletion using touch gestures was insightful.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to RocketSeat for providing the initial challenge and learning resources. The React Native community also deserves a big thank you for their amazing documentation and support.
